# Unidesence
This is an Open-Source project coded in Python within the Blender Game Engine. The player is given a randomized world to build and survive the relentless mobs that plauge the realm. The user achieves this through a helpful companion named BlockBot, and together, the user can build a world his or her own.

Introdution
PythonCraft is a construction/survival game that pits the player against a hostile environment with his imagination and environment as the player’s weapons. This game is a PC game run from an executable that will appeal to fans of common building games found on PC, such as Minecraft, and will also attract players who have been in the indie game market playing similar survival games. The game will feature multiple components, such as building, crafting, fighting, interacting with non player characters, and basic python programming for construction of buildings using the in game items, “BlockBots.”


Overview
PythonCraft uses the open-source Blender game engine.

The player will have the option of being able to input a world code that will spawn a certain type of world or generate it at random. There will also be options that affect the size of the world, how the world is shaded, and much more in the future.

Each world generates in sections we call acres. Every acre is made up of 64 blocks. The world generator also has a displacement modifier that spawns the blocks in the correct lattice. Since there are so many blocks there will be a limit to render distance and how many of them can be shaded at once. Each layer of blocks will be shaded when the player moves to each level.  Of course these things depend on the computing power that each player has in their system and they will be able to modify the code to their liking. 

In this game there will be various creatures, life forms, and beings from vast varieties of worlds that are non player characters.These include the hostile npc’s  zombie, ghost, vampire, the neutral npc’s wolf, yak, and natives, and the passive npc’s rabbit, duck, and goat. Each player will be able to modify and customize their character in almost anyway, shape, or form they want. The players can have the option of teaming up and crossing over worlds to discover and defeat a very powerful faux or attempt to journey alone in cruel, beautiful, strange, fun ,or hostile worlds.  
PythonCraft is targeted towards people of all ages. It will be available on all pc platforms. We hope to release free downloadable copies sometime in the near future. The goal of this game is to help teach the player learn the python programming language in creative and fun ways.









The code for Unidescence will be updated whenever we can work on it. We are currently working on version 0.6
